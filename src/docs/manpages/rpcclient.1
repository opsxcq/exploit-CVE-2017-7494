.SH "NAME"
rpcclient \- tool for executing client side MS\-RPC functions
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\ 'u
rpcclient [\-A\ authfile] [\-c\ <command\ string>] [\-d\ debuglevel] [\-l\ logdir] [\-N] [\-s\ <smb\ config\ file>] [\-U\ username[%password]] [\-W\ workgroup] [\-I\ destinationIP] {server}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite\&.
.PP
rpcclient
is a utility initially developed to test MS\-RPC functionality in Samba itself\&. It has undergone several stages of development and stability\&. Many system administrators have now written scripts around it to manage Windows NT clients from their UNIX workstation\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
server
.RS 4
NetBIOS name of Server to which to connect\&. The server can be any SMB/CIFS server\&. The name is resolved using the
\m[blue]\fBname resolve order\fR\m[]
line from
\fBsmb.conf\fR(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-c|\-\-command=<command string>
.RS 4
Execute semicolon separated commands (listed below)
.RE
.PP
\-I|\-\-dest\-ip IP\-address
.RS 4
\fIIP address\fR
is the address of the server to connect to\&. It should be specified in standard "a\&.b\&.c\&.d" notation\&.
.sp
Normally the client would attempt to locate a named SMB/CIFS server by looking it up via the NetBIOS name resolution mechanism described above in the
\fIname resolve order\fR
parameter above\&. Using this parameter will force the client to assume that the server is on the machine with the specified IP address and the NetBIOS name component of the resource being connected to will be ignored\&.
.sp
There is no default for this parameter\&. If not supplied, it will be determined automatically by the client as described above\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p|\-\-port port
.RS 4
This number is the TCP port number that will be used when making connections to the server\&. The standard (well\-known) TCP port number for an SMB/CIFS server is 139, which is the default\&.

adddriver <arch> <config> [<version>]
.RS 4
Execute an AddPrinterDriver() RPC to install the printer driver information on the server\&. Note that the driver files should already exist in the directory returned by
getdriverdir\&. Possible values for
\fIarch\fR
are the same as those for the
getdriverdir
command\&. The
\fIconfig\fR
parameter is defined as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Long Driver Name:\e
Driver File Name:\e
Data File Name:\e
Config File Name:\e
Help File Name:\e
Language Monitor Name:\e

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Any empty fields should be enter as the string "NULL"\&.
.sp
Samba does not need to support the concept of Print Monitors since these only apply to local printers whose driver can make use of a bi\-directional link for communication\&. This field should be "NULL"\&. On a remote NT print server, the Print Monitor for a driver must already be installed prior to adding the driver or else the RPC will fail\&.
.sp
The
\fIversion\fR
parameter lets you specify the printer driver version number\&. If omitted, the default driver version for the specified architecture will be used\&. This option can be used to upload Windows 2000 (version 3) printer drivers\&.
.RE
.PP
addprinter <printername> <sharename> <drivername> <port>
.RS 4
Add a printer on the remote server\&. This printer will be automatically shared\&. Be aware that the printer driver must already be installed on the server (see
adddriver) and the
\fIport\fRmust be a valid port name (see
enumports\&.
.RE
.PP
deldriver <driver>
.RS 4
Delete the specified printer driver for all architectures\&. This does not delete the actual driver files from the server, only the entry from the server\*(Aqs list of drivers\&.
.RE
.PP
deldriverex <driver> [architecture] [version] [flags]
.RS 4
Delete the specified printer driver and optionally files associated with the driver\&. You can limit this action to a specific architecture and a specific version\&. If no architecture is given, all driver files of that driver will be deleted\&.
\fIflags\fR
correspond to numeric DPD_* values, i\&.e\&. a value of 3 requests (DPD_DELETE_UNUSED_FILES | DPD_DELETE_SPECIFIC_VERSION)\&.
.RE

enumdata
.RS 4

.SH "BUGS"
.PP
rpcclient
is designed as a developer testing tool and may not be robust in certain areas (such as command line parsing)\&. It has been known to generate a core dump upon failures when invalid parameters where passed to the interpreter\&.
.PP
From Luke Leighton\*(Aqs original rpcclient man page:
.PP
\fIWARNING!\fR
The MSRPC over SMB code has been developed from examining Network traces\&. No documentation is available from the original creators (Microsoft) on how MSRPC over SMB works, or how the individual MSRPC services work\&. Microsoft\*(Aqs implementation of these services has been demonstrated (and reported) to be\&.\&.\&. a bit flaky in places\&.
.PP
The development of Samba\*(Aqs implementation is also a bit rough, and as more of the services are understood, it can even result in versions of
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
and
\fBrpcclient\fR(1)
that are incompatible for some commands or services\&. Additionally, the developers are sending reports to Microsoft, and problems found or reported to Microsoft are fixed in Service Packs, which may result in incompatibilities\&.
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 3 of the Samba suite\&.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\&. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\&.
.PP
The original rpcclient man page was written by Matthew Geddes, Luke Kenneth Casson Leighton, and rewritten by Gerald Carter\&. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2\&.2 was done by Gerald Carter\&. The conversion to DocBook XML 4\&.2 for Samba 3\&.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy\&.
