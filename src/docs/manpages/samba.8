.SH "NAME"
samba \- Server to provide AD and SMB/CIFS services to clients
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\ 'u
samba [\-D] [\-i] [\-M\ <model>] [\-\-maximum\-runtime=<seconds>] [\-b] [\-\-help] [\-\-usage] [\-d\ <debug\ level>] [\-\-debug\-stderr] [\-s\ <configuration\ file>] [\-\-option=<smb_conf_param>=<value>] [\-l\ <log\ directory>] [\-\-leak\-report] [\-\-leak\-report\-full] [\-V]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This program is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite\&.
.PP
samba
is the server daemon that provides Active Directory, filesharing and printing services to clients\&. The server provides filespace and directory services to clients using the SMB (or CIFS) protocol and other related protocols such as DCE/RPC, LDAP and Kerberos\&.
.PP
Clients supported include MSCLIENT 3\&.0 for DOS, Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95/98/ME, Windows NT, Windows 2000/XP/2003, OS/2, DAVE for Macintosh, and cifsfs for Linux\&.
.PP
An extensive description of the services that the server can provide is given in the man page for the configuration file controlling the attributes of those services (see
\fBsmb.conf\fR(5)\&. This man page will not describe the services, but will concentrate on the administrative aspects of running the server\&.
.PP
Please note that there are significant security implications to running this server, and the
\fBsmb.conf\fR(5)
manual page should be regarded as mandatory reading before proceeding with installation\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-D|\-\-daemon
.RS 4
If specified, this parameter causes the server to operate as a daemon\&. That is, it detaches itself and runs in the background, fielding requests on the appropriate ports\&. Operating the server as a daemon is the recommended way of running
samba
for servers that provide more than casual use file and print services\&. This switch is assumed if
samba
is executed on the command line of a shell\&.
.RE
.PP
\-i|\-\-interactive
.RS 4
If this parameter is specified it causes the server to run "interactively", not as a daemon, even if the server is executed on the command line of a shell\&. Setting this parameter negates the implicit daemon mode when run from the command line\&.
samba
also logs to standard output, as if the
\-S
parameter had been given\&.
.RE
.PP
\-M model
.RS 4
This parameter can be used to specify the "process model" samba should use\&. This determines how concurrent clients are handled\&. Available process models include
\fIsingle\fR
(everything in a single process),
\fIstandard\fR
(similar behaviour to that of Samba 3),
\fIthread\fR
(single process, different threads\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-maximum\-runtime=seconds
.RS 4
Set maximum runtime of the server process till autotermination in seconds\&.
.RE
.PP
\-b|\-\-show\-build
.RS 4
Print information about how Samba was built\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-usage
.RS 4
Display brief usage message\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug\-stderr
.RS 4
Send debug output to STDERR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-leak\-report
.RS 4
Enable talloc leak reporting on exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-leak\-report\-full
.RS 4
Enable full talloc leak reporting on exit\&.
.RE
.SH "FILES"
.PP
/etc/rc
.RS 4
or whatever initialization script your system uses\&.
.sp
If running the server as a daemon at startup, this file will need to contain an appropriate startup sequence for the server\&.
.RE
.PP
/etc/services
.RS 4
If running the server via the meta\-daemon
inetd, this file must contain a mapping of service name (e\&.g\&., netbios\-ssn) to service port (e\&.g\&., 139) and protocol type (e\&.g\&., tcp)\&.
.RE
.PP
/usr/local/samba/lib/smb\&.conf
.RS 4
This is the default location of the
\fBsmb.conf\fR(5)
server configuration file\&. Other common places that systems install this file are
/usr/samba/lib/smb\&.conf
and
/etc/samba/smb\&.conf\&.
.sp
This file describes all the services the server is to make available to clients\&. See
\fBsmb.conf\fR(5)
for more information\&.
.RE
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
Most diagnostics issued by the server are logged in a specified log file\&. The log file name is specified at compile time, but may be overridden on the command line\&.
.PP
The number and nature of diagnostics available depends on the debug level used by the server\&. If you have problems, set the debug level to 3 and peruse the log files\&.
.PP
Most messages are reasonably self\-explanatory\&. Unfortunately, at the time this man page was created, there are too many diagnostics available in the source code to warrant describing each and every diagnostic\&. At this stage your best bet is still to grep the source code and inspect the conditions that gave rise to the diagnostics you are seeing\&.
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 4 of the Samba suite\&.
.SH "SEE ALSO"

http://samba\&.org/cifs/\&.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\&. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\&.
