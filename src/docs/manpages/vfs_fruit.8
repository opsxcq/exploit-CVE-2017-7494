.SH "NAME"
vfs_fruit \- Enhanced OS X and Netatalk interoperability
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\ 'u
vfs objects = fruit
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This VFS module is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite\&.
.PP
The
vfs_fruit
module provides enhanced compatibility with Apple SMB clients and interoperability with a Netatalk 3 AFP fileserver\&.
.PP
The module should be stacked with
vfs_catia
if enabling character conversion and must be stacked with
vfs_streams_xattr, see the example section for the correct config\&.
.PP
The module enables alternate data streams (ADS) support for a share, intercepts the OS X special streams "AFP_AfpInfo" and "AFP_Resource" and handles them in a special way\&. All other named streams are deferred to
vfs_streams_xattr
which must be loaded together with
vfs_fruit\&.
.PP
vfs_fruit requires "ea support = yes"\&.
.PP
Be careful when mixing shares with and without vfs_fruit\&. OS X clients negotiate SMB2 AAPL protocol extensions on the first tcon, so mixing shares with and without fruit will globally disable AAPL if the first tcon is without fruit\&.
.PP
Having shares with ADS support enabled for OS X client is worthwhile because it resembles the behaviour of Apple\*(Aqs own SMB server implementation and it avoids certain severe performance degradations caused by Samba\*(Aqs case sensitivity semantics\&.
.PP
The OS X metadata and resource fork stream can be stored in a way compatible with Netatalk 3 by setting
fruit:resource = file
and
fruit:metadata = netatalk\&.
.PP
OS X maps NTFS illegal characters to the Unicode private range in SMB requests\&. By setting
fruit:encoding = native, all mapped characters are converted to native ASCII characters\&.
.PP
Finally, share access modes are optionally checked against Netatalk AFP sharing modes by setting
fruit:locking = netatalk\&.
.PP
This module is not stackable other then described in this manpage\&.
.SH "GLOBAL OPTIONS"
.PP
The following options must be set in the global smb\&.conf section and won\*(Aqt take effect when set per share\&.
.PP
fruit:aapl = yes | no
.RS 4
A
\fIglobal\fR
option whether to enable Apple\*(Aqs SMB2+ extension codenamed AAPL\&. Default
\fIyes\fR\&. This extension enhances several deficiencies when connecting from Macs:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
directory enumeration is enriched with Mac relevant filesystem metadata (UNIX mode, FinderInfo, resource fork size and effective permission), as a result the Mac client doesn\*(Aqt need to fetch this metadata individuallly per directory entry resulting in an often tremendous performance increase\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
The ability to query and modify the UNIX mode of directory entries\&.
.RE
.sp
.RE
There\*(Aqs a set of per share options that come into play when
\fIfruit:aapl\fR
is enabled\&. These opions, listed below, can be used to disable the computation of specific Mac metadata in the directory enumeration context, all are enabled by default:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
readdir_attr:aapl_rsize = yes | no
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
readdir_attr:aapl_finder_info = yes | no
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
readdir_attr:aapl_max_access = yes | no
.RE
.sp
.RE
See below for a description of these options\&.
.RE
.PP
fruit:nfs_aces = yes | no
.RS 4
A
\fIglobal\fR
option whether support for querying and modifying the UNIX mode of directory entries via NFS ACEs is enabled, default
\fIyes\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
fruit:copyfile = yes | no
.RS 4
A
\fIglobal\fR
option whether to enable OS X specific copychunk ioctl that requests a copy of a whole file along with all attached metadata\&.
.sp
WARNING: the copyfile request is blocking the client while the server does the copy\&.
.sp
\&.
	      The default is
\fIno\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
fruit:zero_file_id = yes | no
.RS 4
A
\fIglobal\fR
option whether to return zero to queries of on\-disk file identifier, if the client has negotiated AAPL\&.
.sp
Mac applications and / or the Mac SMB client code expect the on\-disk file identifier to have the semantics of HFS+ Catalog Node Identifier (CNID)\&. Samba doesn\*(Aqt provide those semantics, and that occasionally cause usability issues or even data loss\&. Returning a file identifier of zero causes the Mac client to stop using and trusting the file id returned from the server\&.
.sp
The default is
\fIyes\fR\&.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following options can be set either in the global smb\&.conf section or per share\&.
.PP
fruit:resource = [ file | xattr | stream ]
.RS 4
Controls where the OS X resource fork is stored\&.
.sp
\fIImportant: \fRDue to a misspelling in the option parser in all Samba versions 4\&.5 and earlier, this options must be given as
\fIfruit:ressource\fR, ie with two
\fIs\fR\&.
.sp
Users who set this opion to any non\-default setting were still using the default setting of
\fIfile\fR
and are advised to adjust their smb\&.conf to reflect the effective setting and set
\fIfruit:ressource=file\fR
in their smb\&.conf\&. Removing the option line altogether works as well\&.
.sp
Samba 4\&.6 will accept both the correct and the wrong spelling, from Samba 4\&.7 onwards only the correct spelling will be accepted\&.
.sp
Settings:
.sp

.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c

.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c

.el \{\
.sp -1

xattr
\- use a xattr, requires a filesystem with large xattr support and a file IO API compatible with xattrs, this boils down to Solaris and derived platforms and ZFS
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c

.el \{\

stream (experimental)
\- pass the stream on to the next module in the VFS stack\&.
\fIWarning: \fR
this option should not be used with the
\fIstreams_xattr\fR
module due to the extended attributes size limitations of most filesytems\&.

fruit:veto_appledouble = yes | no
.RS 4
\fINote:\fR
this option only applies when
\fIfruit:resource\fR
is set to
\fIfile\fR
(the default)\&.
.sp
When
\fIfruit:resource\fR
is set to
\fIfile\fR, vfs_fruit may create \&._ AppleDouble files\&. This options controls whether these \&._ AppleDouble files are vetoed which prevents the client from accessing them\&.
.sp
Vetoing \&._ files may break some applications, eg extracting Mac ZIP archives from Mac clients failes, because they contain \&._ files\&. Setting this option to false will fix this, but the abstraction leak of exposing the internally created \&._ files may have other unknown side effects\&.
.sp
The default is
\fIyes\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
fruit:posix_rename = yes | no
.RS 4
Whether to enable POSIX directory rename behaviour for OS X clients\&. Without this, directories can\*(Aqt be renamed if any client has any file inside it (recursive!) open\&.
.sp
The default is
\fIyes\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
readdir_attr:aapl_rsize = yes | no
.RS 4
Return resource fork size in SMB2 FIND responses\&.
.sp
The default is
\fIyes\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
readdir_attr:aapl_finder_info = yes | no
.RS 4
Return FinderInfo in SMB2 FIND responses\&.

.RE
.PP
readdir_attr:aapl_max_access = yes | no
.RS 4
Return the user\*(Aqs effective maximum permissions in SMB2 FIND responses\&. This is an expensive computation, setting this to off pretends the use has maximum effective permissions\&.

The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\&. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\&.
